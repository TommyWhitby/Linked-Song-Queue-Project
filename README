The PlayQueue class manages a queue of songs in a music player application. It provides methods for adding, removing, and manipulating songs within the queue.

The addSong method adds a new song to the end of the queue, demonstrating basic queue manipulation skills.

The removeSong methods allow for the removal of a song either by specifying the song itself or by index, showcasing searching and deletion operations within a linked list.

The size method returns the number of songs currently in the queue, demonstrating knowledge of linked list traversal.

The reverseQueue method reverses the order of songs in the queue, showcasing proficiency in linked list manipulation.

The moveSong method moves a song within the queue by a specified amount, illustrating skills in repositioning nodes within a linked list.

The swapSongs method swaps the positions of two songs in the queue, demonstrating proficiency in node manipulation.

The hasCycle method checks for cycles within the queue, showcasing understanding of linked list cycle detection algorithms.

The shuffledQueue method creates a randomly shuffled version of the queue, using a formula to determine the new order while avoiding cycles, demonstrating proficiency in algorithm design and implementation.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data structure manipulation, algorithm design, and object-oriented programming principles.
